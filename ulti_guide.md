# Ultimatum Loot Guide

- **Round loot is determined by round #.** Odds are detailed below.
- Map rarity does nothing, map pack size does nothing.
- Map quantity scales **only** catalysts.

## Scarabs

### Catalysing + Inscribed

- Nothing affects loot besides doing more rounds/hour and duping round loot.
- **Solo only** — only the map owner gets the inscribed ultimatums.

### 2x Bribing (optionally inscribing)

- Every player gets the same loot; rewards scale linearly with player count.
- Inscribed only applies to the map owner — not a major change.
